Notes for Florida TBD-John Jordan

Shown in: FamilySearch.. "John H Gordan (Jordan), United States Census, 1950: Detroit. Census Records 1950"


'Melissa E' was shown as the spouse in John Jordan's household. I suspect that the E was in error for F and middle name of Florida was used commonly as given name.
