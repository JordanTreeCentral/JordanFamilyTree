Notes for Matinee Terrell

Married surname Jordan. Born in 1894.

1910 Census records show Mattine Terrell, not Matinee, as shown in Robert Jordan Sr Obituary. Obviously a census clerk error which is a usual error in that time frame.  

"Claudia" is reportedly Matinee's white Mother.

Date of Death estimate Jun 1954 in Detroit, MI
